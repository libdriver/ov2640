## LibDriver OV2640

[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/ov2640/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)

The OV2640 CAMERACHIP™ image sensor is a low voltage CMOS device that provides the full functionality of a single-chip UXGA (1632x1232) camera and image processor in a small footprint package. The OV2640 provides full-frame, sub-sampled, scaled or windowed 8-bit/10-bit images in a wide range of formats, controlled through the Serial Camera Control Bus (SCCB) interface. 

This product has an image array capable of operating at up to 15 frames per second (fps) in UXGA resolution with complete user control over image quality, formatting and output data transfer. All required image processing functions, including exposure control, gamma, white balance, color saturation, hue control, white pixel canceling, noise canceling, and more, are also programmable through the SCCB interface. The OV2640 also includes a compression engine for increased processing power. In addition, OmniVision CAMERACHIP sensors use proprietary sensor technology to improve image quality by reducing or eliminating common lighting/electrical sources of image contamination, such as fixed pattern noise, smearing, etc., to produce a clean, fully stable color image.

LibDriver OV2640 is a full-featured driver of OV2640 launched by LibDriver.It provides image display, image capture, special effects settings and other functions. LibDriver is MISRA compliant.

### Instruction

/src includes LibDriver OV2640 source files.

/interface includes LibDriver OV2640 SCCB, DVP platform independent template.

/test includes LibDriver OV2640 driver test code and this code can test the chip necessary function simply.

/example includes LibDriver OV2640 sample code.

/doc includes LibDriver OV2640 offline document.

/datasheet includes OV2640 datasheet.

/project includes the common Linux and MCU development board sample code. All projects use the shell script to debug the driver and the detail instruction can be found in each project's README.md.

/misra includes the LibDriver MISRA code scanning results.

### Install

Reference /interface SCCB, DVP platform independent template and finish your platform SCCB, DVP driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.

#### example display

```C
#include "driver_ov2640_basic.h"

uint8_t res;

/* basic init */
res = ov2640_basic_init();
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

/* set to rgb565 mode */
res = ov2640_basic_set_rgb565_mode();
if (res != 0)
{
    (void)ov2640_basic_deinit();

    return 1;
}

/* set image resolution */
res = ov2640_basic_set_image_resolution(OV2640_IMAGE_RESOLUTION_QQVGA);
if (res != 0)
{
    (void)ov2640_basic_deinit();

    return 1;
}

/* delay 500ms */
ov2640_interface_delay_ms(500);

...

/* finish your display progress */    

...

/* ov2640 deinit */
(void)ov2640_basic_deinit();

return 0;
```

#### example photo

```C
#include "driver_ov2640_basic.h"

uint8_t res;

/* basic init */
res = ov2640_basic_init();
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

/* set to jpeg mode */
res = ov2640_basic_set_jpeg_mode();
if (res != 0)
{
    (void)ov2640_basic_deinit();

    return 1;
}

/* set image resolution */
res = ov2640_basic_set_image_resolution(OV2640_IMAGE_RESOLUTION_QQVGA);
if (res != 0)
{
    (void)ov2640_basic_deinit();

    return 1;
}

/* delay 500ms */
ov2640_interface_delay_ms(500);

...

/* finish your jpeg captrue progress */    

...

/* ov2640 deinit */
(void)ov2640_basic_deinit();

return 0;
```
